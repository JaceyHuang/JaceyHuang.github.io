My name is Jason Ansel.  I am currently working on PyTorch Compilers
at Facebook.</p>

<p>Before Facebook, I was at GoDaddy helping build a deep learning platform
for predicting small business behavior and personalizing experiences across
the company.  I also created <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/engineering/2019/07/26/domain-name-valuation/">GoDaddy Domain Appraisals</a>, which uses neural
networks to predict the resale value of a domain name better than a human
expert.  I joined GoDaddy in 2013 as part of the <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130819/godaddy-acquires-merchant-finder-startup-locu-for-70-million/">acquisition</a> of the startup
<a href="http://locu.com/">Locu</a>, which I joined in 2011 while I was simultaneously getting my Ph.D. at
<a href="http://www.mit.edu/">MIT</a> <a href="http://www.csail.mit.edu/">CSAIL</a>.</p>

<p>I did my Ph.D. dissertation in the <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/commit/">Commit</a> group lead by  <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/saman/">Saman Amarasinghe</a>.
I started the <a href="http://opentuner.org/">OpenTuner</a> project, an extensible framework for program
autotuning.  I also created the <a href="http://projects.csail.mit.edu/petabricks/">PetaBricks</a> programming language, a language
that incorporates algorithmic choices to allow an integrated autotuner to
explore search spaces of program implementations.  As an undergraduate, I did
research with <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/gene/">Gene Cooperman</a> and helped create <a href="http://dmtcp.sourceforge.net/">DMTCP</a>, a user-level
distributed checkpoint/restart system.</p>
